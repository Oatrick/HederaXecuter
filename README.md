# Example Micropayment Payment Server

This is an example Payment Server for the [Hedera Hashgraph](https://hedera.com/) public network. It acts as a payment gateway, allowing developers to more easily monetize of any type of content on the web via micropayments.

## Background

Hedera's example payment server was originally built for Hedera's community testing program, alongside example mobile wallets ([iOS](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-wallet-ios), [Android](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-wallet-android)), a [WordPress plugin](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-micropayment), and a [chrome browser extension](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-browser-extension).

You can read a [technical deep dive on Hedera's community testing program](https://www.hedera.com/blog/a-technical-deep-dive-hederas-community-testing-program), written by [Calvin Cheng](https://github.com/calvinchengx), if you're curious to learn more.

## How it works

We implemented a socketio based server that listens to a socketio event, in this case a `CRYPTOTRANSFER` from our [Hedera Browser Extension](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-browser-extension).

Next it will receive a cryptographically signed CryptoTransfer transaction object passed from the [Hedera Browser Extension](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-browser-extension).

On receipt of the signed transaction object from the [Hedera Browser Extension](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-browser-extension), this payment server will then proxy the transaction object to a node in Hedera Network, via a gRPC network call.

The [gRPC](https://www.grpc.io/faq/) response from Hedera Network will then be handled and _pushed back_ to listening socketio clients via the `CRYPTOTRANSFER_RESPONSE` event, in our example's case, a WordPress website and plugin.

## Technology Stack

While this Payment Server could be implemented in any language of your choosing, for our purposes, we choose to implement with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) using the very popular [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) framework.

It also uses [socket.io](https://socket.io/) for persistent connections between the [Hedera Browser Extension](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-browser-extension), this payment server, and clients wishing to interact with both.

Hedera Hashgraph's APIs are [implemented in protobufs](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-protobuf) are [used in this project](/src/hedera/pbnode/), which you can learn more about [here](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).

## Set Up

```
# node dependencies
npm install
# set up config/index.js by using the sample config/index.js.sample as reference
```
